                <ul>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</ul>

                <ul>Coriander, cumin, paprika, and if you like spice, add a pinch of red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.</ul>
                <ul>6 Fresh medium-size tomatoes and about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.</ul>
                <ul>6 large raw eggs</ul>

            <ol>
                <li> Start by sauteing chopped onions, bell peppers, and garlic with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy skillet or pan (with a lid)</li>
                <li>Season with kosher salt and coriander, paprika, cumin, and crushed pepper flakes.</li>
                <li>Cook for at least 5 minutes, stirring, until the veggies are tender, then add fresh diced tomatoes (I used 6 vine ripe tomatoes) and Â½ cup of tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Bring the tomatoes to a boil, then cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes, then uncover and cook a few more minutes until your sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs and cook.</li>
                <li>When the sauce is ready, use the back of a spoon and make some holes in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Crack your eggs and nestle each egg in one of the holes you created.</li>
                <li>Cover the skillet and allow the eggs to simmer in the sauce over medium-low heat until the egg whites have settled. If you like your eggs hard, cook them a bit longer.</li>
                <li>Once the eggs are ready, garnish with parsley and serve immediately!</li>
