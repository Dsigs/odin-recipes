# odin-recipes
In this project we're are going to make a recipe website.

The project will start with only using HTML but will be expanded upon later using CSS and JavaScript to add style, but for now it is going to be a demonstration of the following: Create a proper HTML Boilerplate, paragraph creation and potential usage of strong and italic text, images with clearly defined alt descriptions for the visually impaired, ordered and unordered listing, and usage of both absolute and relative links.
